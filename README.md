# Babytracker 
App project for parents designed to track newborn and baby activities.

👶 The app keeps a comprehensive log of a baby’s activities, including feeding times, bottle feeding, playtime, diaper changes, and sleep. It also features a dashboard with both weekly and overall statistics for these activities, providing insights into patterns. 

🍼 Additionally, there is a dedicated section for tracking diaper changes and bottle feedings, showing the time since the last change or feeding. 

🧑‍💻 The app is built using React and consumes an API to handle data management and synchronization.
